# Biography

I am a Canada Research Chair in Population Physical Activity in the School of Human Kinetics and Recreation at Memorial University. My research is focused on using wearable technologies to study physical activity, transportation interventions, and equity in urban spaces. I have an MSc in Kinesiology from the University of Saskatchewan, a PhD in Public Health from Université de Montréal. I am a Principal Investigator for the INTErventions, Research, and Action in Cities Team (INTERAC) and the Neighbourhood Factors Team co-lead of the Canadian Urban Environmental Health (CANUE) Research Consortium. I spends free time chasing his two rambunctious kids, and relives his youth playing recreational basketball on Mondays and Wednesdays.
